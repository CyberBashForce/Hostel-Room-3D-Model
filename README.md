# Hostel Room 3D Model

This repository contains a **3D recreation** of my college hostel room, created using **Blender**. This project was made as a memory for my future self, capturing the essence of the space I lived in during my college years. It also serves as an asset for **game developers**, providing a detailed and realistic environment that can be used as part of any game or virtual space.
